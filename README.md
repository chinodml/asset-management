# Fuwa Fuwa Admin Panel

This is a simple web-based admin panel created as a final project for our Elective subject.

## Overview

The **Fuwa Fuwa Admin Panel** is designed for managing basic admin tasks in a hypothetical bread manufacturing company. It features a clean, responsive interface built using **HTML**, **JavaScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

The goal of the project was to create a minimal but functional system with user authentication and a basic dashboard structure.

## Features

- **Login & Sign-Up** functionality using **Firebase Authentication**
- Firebase **Firestore** integration for storing user information
- A simple **static dashboard** with a sidebar and topbar layout
- Responsive and mobile-friendly design using **Tailwind CSS**
- Warm, bakery-themed UI using a custom orange-brown motif

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES Modules)**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Firebase (Auth + Firestore)**

## Project Structure

- `index.html` – main page
- `scripts/` – JS logic (auth, routing, UI components)
- `pages/` – login, signup, and dashboard views
- `styles/` – custom styles
- `images/` – logo and background assets

## Notes

This is a frontend-focused mock application. It does not include backend validation, role management, or real asset tracking — just enough for demonstrating login, routing, and UI layout as part of our final submission.
